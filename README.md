<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![website-preview]("https://github.com/ChengCK18/Web-App-for-Satellite-Image-Segmentation/tree/main/readme_doc/website%20preview.PNG?raw=true")

The main idea of this project is to construct a website that allows user to select an area on the satellite imagery map and to understand its land usage. This project utilize deep learning segementation model trained on Keras with dataset from <a href='https://landcover.ai/'>Land Cover</a>. There are a total of 5 land use classes for this model which are:
<ol>  
<li>Background (Unlabelled)</li>  
<li>Buildings</li>  
<li>Trees and greens</li>  
<li>Water</li>  
<li>Road</li>  
</ol>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started



### Prerequisites
Define the following in .env file as 'REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY' (Frontend folder) and 'WEB_URL' (Backend folder)respectively
<ul>
<li>A google map javascript API key
<li>Website URL to retrieve (256px x 256px)satellite image based on longitude and latitude. (Scrapping code needs to be modified accordingly)
</ul>

### Installation

Install all the dependencies and packages by navigating to the root(where package.json is located) of the Frontend and Backend folder and run the script below.


1. Clone the repo

  ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ChengCK18/Web-App-for-Satellite-Image-Segmentation.git
   ```
  2. Install NPM packages for both folders
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
  3. Start the application for both folders
   ```sh
    npm start
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Press on the location of interest on the google map and press the query button to retrieve  the area of interest's satellite image and to segment its land usage.

## Issues

<ol>
<li>The model was trained and tested on the dataset and achieve a decent result with IoU score of 0.7168 out of 1.000 but as expected, when the model is used to inference places out of Poland, and other parts of Central Europe(dataset origin), the model is unusable due to its poor performance. Factors include:
<ul>
	<li> Web scrapped satellite image quality is different from the dataset trained and validated upon.
	<li> Satellite images appears different based on different part of the world as images are taken by different satellite
	<li> Dataset used is not diversed as it only includes a small region.
	
</ul>

</ol>

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## To do

- [ ] Improve model performance
- [ ] Error handling for server and frontend side
- [ ] Error caused by resizing process using setattribute which sometimes does not work causing image to be larger than input size of model
- [ ] Tidying up and refactoring code
